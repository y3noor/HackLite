# Binary Challenge Setup Guide

Welcome to the Binary Challenge Setup Guide! This README provides comprehensive instructions on how to set up, run, and interact with a binary exploitation challenge using Docker. Follow these steps to ensure you have everything ready for a deep dive into binary exploitation.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get your challenge up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See the deployment section for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have the following installed on your system:
- Docker
- Netcat

You can install these on Ubuntu with:

```sh
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install docker.io netcat
```

#### Step 1: Docker Setup

Navigate to the directory containing your Docker files and run the following commands to build and run your Docker container:

```sh
sh dockerbuild.sh
sh dockerrun.sh
```

This will create a Docker container that will run the binary challenge.

#### Step 2: Verify the Setup

Use Docker and Netcat to verify the setup:

```sh
docker ps
```

Note the port number your challenge is listening on, then:

```sh
nc localhost <port_number>
```

Replace `<port_number>` with the actual port to ensure the challenge is operational.

### Extracting libc.so.6

To perform local exploitation, you might need the exact version of libc.so.6 used by the Docker container. Use the following command to copy it from the container to your host:

```sh
docker cp <container_id_or_name>:docker cp 2954509630a6:/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 .
```

Adjust the source path based on where libc.so.6 is located within your container. You can use `sudo updatedb && locate libc.so.6` or `sudo find / -name libc.so.6` to find the path. 

### Starting the Exploitation

With the setup complete and libc.so.6 extracted, you're now ready to start hacking. Use your skills and tools to analyze the binary, find vulnerabilities, and develop exploits.
